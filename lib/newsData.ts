      <p>Saint George extended their lead at the top of the Ethiopian Premier League with a convincing 3-1 victory over Fasil Kenema at Addis Ababa Stadium on Sunday.</p>
      
      <p>The Horsemen dominated proceedings from the start, with Getaneh Kebede opening the scoring in the 17th minute after a brilliant through ball from Shimeles Bekele. Shimeles doubled the advantage just before halftime with a powerful strike from outside the box.</p>
      
      <p>Fasil Kenema showed some resistance in the second half and pulled one back through a penalty by Dawit Fekadu in the 65th minute. However, Saint George restored their two-goal cushion in the 78th minute when substitute Aynalem Hailu capitalized on a defensive error.</p>
      
      <p>"We played with determination today," said Saint George coach Gebremedhin Haile after the match. "The players executed our game plan perfectly, and I'm proud of their performance."</p>
      
      <p>This victory puts Saint George five points clear at the top of the table with 28 points from 10 games, while Fasil Kenema remains in second place with 23 points.</p>

      <p>The Ethiopian Football Federation (EFF) is seriously considering the introduction of Video Assistant Referee (VAR) technology in the Premier League starting next season, sources have told Pana Sports.</p>
      
      <p>The move comes after several controversial refereeing decisions in recent matches that have sparked outrage among fans, players, and club officials.</p>
      
      <p>According to our sources, the EFF has already held preliminary discussions with FIFA about the implementation process and costs involved. A delegation is expected to travel to Europe next month to study how VAR is being used in smaller leagues.</p>
      
      <p>"Refereeing standards have been a major concern this season," said EFF president in an exclusive interview. "We believe VAR could help improve the quality of officiating and ensure fair play for all teams."</p>
      
      <p>If introduced, Ethiopia would become only the third African country after Egypt and South Africa to implement VAR technology in their domestic league.</p>
